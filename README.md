# ArnoldBot

This is the first discord bot that I created: Arnold Bot. Currently a WIP.

# Commands:

!help, states commands to be entered by users <br />
!hello, the bot gives a greeting message <br />
!play, plays the youtube URL following this command <br />

# Automatic Functions:

DadBot, replies with a dad joke when a user types "I'm" + a message after <br />
LanguageFilter: filters through a list of words that are banned and removes the message
