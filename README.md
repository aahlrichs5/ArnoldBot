# ArnoldBot

This is my first discord bot. The purpose of this bot is to get a better understanding
of the capabilities of JS. Another purpose is to have an auto-moderator filter through
chat messages when I am offline. The bot is currently a work in progress and I am still
adding new features that will be listed here when complete.

# Commands:

!help, states commands to be entered by users <br />
!hello, the bot gives a greeting message <br />
!play, plays the youtube URL following this command in the voice channel of the user <br />

# Automatic Functions:

DadBot: replies with a dad joke when a user types "I'm" + a message after <br />
LanguageFilter: filters through a list of words that are banned and removes the message
